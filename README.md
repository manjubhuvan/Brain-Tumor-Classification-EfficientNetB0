# Brain Tumor Classification 

This project focuses on classifying brain tumor MRI images using a deep learning model built with **EfficientNetB0** and **Transfer Learning**.  
The model predicts four classes: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary Tumor**, and **No Tumor**.

## Project Overview
- MRI-based brain tumor classification  
- Uses a pretrained EfficientNetB0 model  
- Includes Grad-CAM visualizations for explainability  
- High accuracy achieved with fine-tuning and augmentation  

## Model Performance
- Training Accuracy: ~98%  
- Validation Accuracy: ~96%  
- Testing Accuracy: ~95–97%  

## How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt



### Run the Application
python app.py


## Summary
This project demonstrates a deep learning approach for brain tumor detection with strong accuracy and visual explainability using Grad-CAM.
